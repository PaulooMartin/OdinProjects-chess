# OdinProjects-chess

### Goals
1. Get a CLI Chess working with all of the rules
1. Keep the code consistent, testable and tested, and maintainable
1. Compression Oriented Programming
1. Refactor upto extendability if needed

### Not my Goals
1. To create the perfect OOP example
1. Refactor until things are perfect


### What I could have done better

A. Ask questions more often
- There were some things that I could have saved time on if I had done more research or ask questions about.

B. Know the gap between planning and implementing
- There was a time wherein I spent an entire week or two mostly frozen due to questions like "will this make a good design?" or "Is this following the OOP principles?" and so on. I wish I knew the gap between planning and implementing.

C. Plan enough, make it work, make it better
- As of writing (July 31 2023), I am doing my best to implement this new workflow. The idea behind it is that to (1) Plan just enough so that progress will still be made and I won't be frozen in my own head, (2) Make it work first then (3) Make it better. Often times (with myself) #3 comes first before #2 which, now thinking about it, does not make complete sense if I do not have code to write it better.

D. Taking care of myself
- Today is August 14. I took a 10 day break starting August 1st upto 11th, reason for being is because I was at a point of neglecting my life. I love programming and was spending a boat load of time each day into it but unfortunately the other areas of my life are very screwed so I had to take a break.
- Although I cannot say that my health and other areas are now secure, I am now better aware of it than before - which is good enough for me. I just need to stop myself from forgetting about the other areas.

E. Setting goals early

F. Writing automated tests
